# Scaffold React Vite Sample

## Objectives
- Provide a minimal React application scaffolded with the latest Vite template under `samples/`.
- Demonstrate current best-practice project structure for a Vite-powered React app.

## Requirements
- Create a new folder `samples/` if it does not already exist and add a subfolder for this sample project.
- Use the official Vite React (JavaScript) template with the newest available React and Vite versions.
- Configure the project with npm scripts for development, build, and preview as generated by Vite.
- Include the default Vite-generated README updated with project name and basic run instructions.
- Introduce a reusable styling and theming setup (e.g. shared CSS variables or theme context) without diverging from the scaffold's default structure.

## Constraints
- Limit customisations to naming, README updates, and the minimal reusable styling/theming setup described above.
- Keep dependencies limited to those installed by the Vite React template.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `samples/<project-name>/package.json` exists with dependencies referencing the latest React and Vite releases at generation time.
- `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and `npm run build` succeed locally using the generated project.
- README in the sample folder clearly states how to install dependencies and start the dev server.
- Repository contains no additional files or configuration unrelated to the scaffolded Vite React sample.
